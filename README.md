This is a simple Python program that helps users calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

Users are asked to:

Enter the total bill amount

Choose a tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%)

Enter the number of people splitting the bill

The program then calculates and displays the amount each person should pay, including their share of the tip.
